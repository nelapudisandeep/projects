$ this is a project for the purpose of analysing the questions in the question papers
$ questions in question papers of various competitive exams or academic exams are taken from different topics of the text book.
$ In order to have a clear cut idea of "which topic is more important ? " can be probably solved by taking a look at previous question papers
$ In previous question papers we have questions which are repeated some times and if we know the topic which is being asked more frequently will be helpful
$ on this idea this application was made

$ usuage : 
========== 
$ entering the topics name by using add button
$ after entering the topics of concern click on the submit button to get the total number of questions of that particular topic
$ there is also a facility to analyse the topics in a pie chart in order to get the clarity visually.
$ upon refreshing the page the list is cleared.

$ Thank You....
